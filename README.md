# ESP32-C3 Boiler OTA binaries

Public hosting for ESP32-C3 Boiler firmware binaries only.

**Important:** The first `Boiler_ESP32C3_V1_01_TEST_ONLY.bin` is a **bench-test build**, not a certified production release. Do not connect any boiler loads or activate control outputs. The firmware remains measurement-only.

Files named `Boiler_ESP32C3_V*.bin` are **ESP32-C3 only**; they must never be installed on ESP8266.

Remote MQTT OTA is enabled only for a **newer matching version** with explicit operator confirmation and PIN. The first installation is through USB.

This repository is public. Only publish firmware that contains no Wi-Fi passwords, MQTT credentials, personal secrets or device-specific encryption keys. Firmware downloads must ultimately use HTTPS with certificate verification or signed-image validation. MD5 alone is not an authentication mechanism.

See the [private development firmware repository](https://github.com/ApostolosGit/ESP32-C3-BOILER).
